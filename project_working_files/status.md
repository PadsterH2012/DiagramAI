# Project Status and Task Management

## CRITICAL: Agent Execution Rules

**MANDATORY STATUS UPDATE REQUIREMENT**:
- Agents MUST check this file before starting any work (RESUME CAPABILITY)
- Agents MUST update this file before starting any module
- Agents MUST update this file upon completing any module
- Agents MUST NOT proceed to the next module without updating status to COMPLETED
- All status changes MUST include timestamp and brief completion summary

**RESUME CAPABILITY**:
- This file determines where agents resume work after interruption
- Agents MUST validate completed modules before proceeding
- If validation fails, mark module as NEEDS_VALIDATION and restart
- Never restart completed work unless validation fails

**TASK BREAKDOWN INTEGRATION**:
- Complex tasks MUST be organized into logical, manageable components
- Task breakdown files are stored in working_files/tasks/ (within project_working_files)
- This status file tracks overall module progress, breakdown files track component progress

---

## Status Definitions

- **NOT_STARTED**: Module has not been initiated by any agent
- **IN_PROGRESS**: Module execution has begun but deliverables are not complete
- **COMPLETED**: All module deliverables have been created and validated according to module requirements

## Validation Checkpoints

Before marking any module as COMPLETED, verify:

1. **All required deliverables exist** in the specified locations
2. **Content aligns with project_plan.txt** requirements
3. **Research sources are documented** with URLs and dates (for research modules)
4. **File paths follow the portable folder structure** relative to project_instructions/
5. **No assumptions made** without explicit research validation

## Task Breakdown Tracking

### Active Task Breakdowns
[This section tracks large tasks that have been broken down into micro-tasks]

**Format**: [Module] - [Task Name] - Status: [Active/Complete] - File: ../../project_working_files/working_files/tasks/[filename]

### Completed Task Breakdowns
[This section archives completed task breakdowns for reference]

## Next Module Execution Rules

- **Module 0 (Initial Setup)**: Can start immediately after reading project_plan.txt
- **Module 1 (Research Phase)**: Requires Module 0 status = COMPLETED
- **Module 2 (Documentation Development)**: Requires Module 1 status = COMPLETED
- **Module 3 (LLD Structure and Creation)**: Requires Module 2 status = COMPLETED
- **Module 4 (Task and Gap Management)**: Requires Module 3 status = IN_PROGRESS or COMPLETED
- **Module 5 (Validation and Planning)**: Requires Module 4 status = COMPLETED

**CRITICAL**: Agents MUST check this status file before executing any module to ensure prerequisites are met.

## Resume Instructions for Agents

1. **Read this status file first** - determine current state
2. **Validate completed modules** - check deliverables exist
3. **Check for active task breakdowns** - resume micro-tasks if needed
4. **Start from correct module** - based on status and validation
5. **Update status as work progresses** - maintain accurate tracking
