## Technology Recommendations Based on Research

### Frontend Stack
1. **React 18+** with TypeScript for type safety and modern features
2. **React Flow v11.11.4** for interactive diagram editing capabilities
3. **Mermaid.js** for text-based diagram rendering and editing
4. **Next.js 14+** for full-stack React framework with App Router

### AI Integration
1. **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** as the primary AI integration standard
2. **Multiple AI Provider Support**: OpenAI API, Claude API, Azure AI for redundancy
3. **Real-time AI Processing**: WebSocket connections for live diagram analysis

### Development Infrastructure
1. **TypeScript** for enhanced developer experience and type safety
2. **Modern Build Tools**: Vite or Next.js built-in bundling
3. **Component Testing**: React Testing Library with Jest
4. **End-to-End Testing**: Playwright for full application testing

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- **React Flow Integration**: Mature library with strong community support
- **Mermaid.js Integration**: Well-established with good documentation
- **Basic Web Development**: Standard technologies with extensive resources

### Medium Risk
- **Bidirectional Conversion**: Complex semantic preservation between formats
- **Real-time AI Integration**: Requires careful state management and error handling
- **Performance with Large Diagrams**: May require optimization strategies

### High Risk
- **AI API Reliability**: Dependency on external AI services
- **MCP Ecosystem Maturity**: Relatively new standard, though rapidly growing
