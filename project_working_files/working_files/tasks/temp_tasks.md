- Set up cross-module integration tracking

## Next Steps
1. Begin feature list creation based on project_scope.md
2. Start systematic LLD review for gap identification
3. Initiate research process for identified gaps
4. Establish regular task update schedule

## Notes
- All tasks must reference Module 1 research findings for validation
- Gap resolutions must be research-backed with documented sources
- Regular updates required to maintain task tracking accuracy
- Cross-module dependencies must be monitored and managed
