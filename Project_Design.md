# AI-Powered Interactive Diagramming Tool
## Project Design Document

### Executive Summary

**Project Name:** DiagramAI (working title)  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** May 28, 2025  

DiagramAI is a web-based application that creates an intelligent feedback loop between AI-generated system diagrams and human editing capabilities. Users describe their application logic in natural language, receive AI-generated diagrams (visual flow or Mermaid), edit them in their preferred format with bidirectional conversion capabilities, and get AI analysis of their changes to identify logic gaps and improvements.

### Problem Statement

Current workflow challenges:
- AI-generated diagrams from natural language are static and non-interactive
- No easy way to refine AI-generated diagrams while maintaining AI understanding
- Difficult to visualize and debug complex application logic flows
- Gap between conceptual descriptions and detailed system design
- Time-consuming process to iterate on system architecture diagrams
- Lack of interoperability between visual flow diagrams and text-based formats
- Designers and developers prefer different diagram formats but need to collaborate

### Solution Overview

A web application that provides:
- Natural language to diagram generation (visual flow or Mermaid) via AI
- Interactive visual flow diagram editing with drag-and-drop interface
- Text-based Mermaid editing with live preview
- **Bidirectional conversion between visual flow diagrams and Mermaid syntax**
- AI understanding of both visual and text-based diagram modifications
- Logic analysis and gap identification across both formats
- Iterative refinement workflow with format flexibility

#### Key User Flows

**Primary Flow:**
1. User enters natural language description of their app
2. User selects preferred output format (visual flow or Mermaid)
3. AI generates initial diagram in chosen format
4. System displays diagram with editing interface
5. User makes edits in preferred format (visual or text)

7. AI analyzes changes and provides feedback regardless of format
8. Iterative refinement continues with full format flexibility

**Secondary Flows:**
- Import existing Mermaid diagrams and convert to visual flow
- Import visual diagrams and generate Mermaid code
- Export diagrams in multiple formats (PNG, SVG, PDF, Mermaid, JSON)
- Share diagrams with format preferences for different team members
- Version comparison across different formats

- Progressive loading for complex interfaces

### Risk Assessment

#### High Risk
- **AI API Reliability**: Dependency on external AI services
  - *Mitigation*: Multiple AI provider support, fallback mechanisms

#### Medium Risk
- **Bidirectional Conversion Complexity**: Maintaining semantic equivalence between formats
  - *Mitigation*: Start with basic conversion, iterative improvement, extensive testing
- **Complex Visual Editing**: Building intuitive flow diagram editing tools  
  - *Mitigation*: Use proven libraries (React Flow), focus on core features first
- **Real-time Synchronization**: Maintaining state across multiple users and formats
  - *Mitigation*: Phase 3 feature, extensive testing, format-aware conflict resolution

#### Low Risk
- **Mermaid Integration**: Well-established library with good documentation
- **Flow Diagram Libraries**: Mature options like React Flow with strong community support

### Conclusion

DiagramAI addresses a clear need in the development workflow by bridging the gap between AI-generated diagrams and human design expertise, while solving the interoperability challenge between visual and text-based diagram formats. The bidirectional conversion system creates unprecedented flexibility for teams with mixed preferences - designers can work visually while developers can work with text, yet both maintain semantic consistency.

The phased approach allows for rapid validation of both the core AI-diagram feedback loop and the innovative conversion capabilities. The use of MCP provides a solid foundation for AI integration, while established technologies like React Flow and Mermaid.js reduce implementation risk.

The project offers significant value even in its MVP form, with the unique dual-format approach potentially setting it apart from existing diagramming tools. The conversion engine becomes a key differentiator that could drive adoption across diverse user bases with different workflow preferences.
