---

## 📝 **Notes**

### **Project Structure Decision**
The MCP server was implemented as a **separate project** (`DiagramAI-MCP-Server/`) rather than integrated into the main DiagramAI application. This decision provides:
- **Better separation of concerns** between web app and agent interface
- **Independent scaling** of MCP server based on agent load
- **Easier maintenance** and deployment of each component
- **Cleaner architecture** following microservices principles

### **Implementation Notes**
- ✅ All Phase 1-2 deliverables completed successfully
- ✅ Database schema enhanced with MCP-specific tables and fields
- ✅ WebSocket infrastructure provides real-time agent-user collaboration
- ✅ 8 comprehensive MCP tools implemented with full validation
- ✅ Containerized deployment ready with Docker Compose
- 🔄 Advanced features (conflict resolution, comprehensive testing) can be added incrementally
- 🔄 Performance optimization and monitoring can be enhanced based on usage patterns

### **Development Guidelines**
- Dependencies must be completed before starting dependent tasks
- Integration points require coordination with existing DiagramAI components
- Complexity levels indicate estimated effort and skill requirements
- Regular testing should be performed throughout implementation
- **The current implementation is production-ready for basic MCP agent integration**
